# filmPortal
Film rental administration portal

This project is to show usage of the following technologies:

spring-boot
MVC framework
hibernate
jpa
mysql
solid JQuery

(no tests, this is only a study project)


Dockerized version. Only one problem to solve: somewhy the DDL function of Hibernate doesn't work over here. For docker-compose up, throws sqlstate:42S02. Table "videodata.user" doesn't exist.
